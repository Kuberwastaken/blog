QR codes have transformed our everyday interactions—from scanning a restaurant menu to processing contactless payments. Yet behind their pixelated façade lurks a world of technical vulnerabilities and cyberattack vectors that hackers are eager to exploit. In this deep dive, we’ll dissect the inner workings of QR codes, examine the sophisticated malware and phishing techniques (affectionately known as “quishing”) that abuse them, and provide technical as well as practical advice for staying safe in the QR era.

## 1. How QR Codes Work: A Technical Primer

### Data Capacity and Encoding

A typical QR code can store up to **3KB of data**—enough to encode thousands of characters or a compressed script for a malware payload. Depending on the data type, it can store:

- **7,089 numeric characters**
- **4,296 alphanumeric characters**
- **2,953 binary bytes**  
    This capacity is achieved through various encoding modes (numeric, alphanumeric, byte, and kanji), each optimized for different data types. Such flexibility, however, also means that a hacker can embed not only a legitimate URL but also a cleverly obfuscated malicious payload in just a few kilobytes of data

I recently created a custom compression algorithm for QR codes using a combination of Zlib and Gzip that managed to compress an entire re-creation of Doom coded in minified HTML in a single QR code (you can read more about it here) so QR codes do have a huge potential of being dangerous.
### Error Correction: Friend or Foe?

QR codes incorporate error correction—using Reed-Solomon algorithms—to remain scannable even if partially damaged. There are four levels (L, M, Q, H), with Level H capable of recovering up to 30% of data. While this ensures reliability, it also lets attackers embed “hidden” malicious links in QR codes that have been deliberately minimized or overlaid, making detection even harder

## 2. Vulnerabilities and Attack Vectors

QR codes are inherently simple; they’re just data carriers. But this simplicity is what makes them a ripe target for cybercriminals. Let’s explore the common attack vectors:

### A. Malware Distribution

- **Trojan Delivery:** Malicious QR codes can direct users to download banking trojans (e.g., Coper/Octo2), which use advanced obfuscation and device takeover features to steal credentials and control devices. For instance, QR codes embedded in mailed letters have been used to trigger auto-downloads of malware that covertly infiltrate smartphones
    
    [malwarebytes.com](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2024/11/malicious-qr-codes-sent-in-the-mail-deliver-malware)
    
    .
- **Ransomware and Botnets:** In some attacks, QR codes lead to URLs that download ransomware or add the device to a botnet used for DDoS attacks. Hackers exploit vulnerabilities in poorly secured QR code readers, making malware installation almost instantaneous.

### B. Phishing and “Quishing”

- **QR Code Phishing (Quishing):** Cybercriminals create QR codes that redirect users to fake login pages mimicking reputable sites. Once the victim enters credentials, the information is siphoned off. In 2025, studies show that nearly 22% of phishing attacks now involve QR codes, a trend driven by the ease of bypassing email filters with image-based attacks .
- **Multi-Device Attacks:** Often, the phishing email arrives on a corporate computer, but the QR code is scanned on a personal mobile device—typically less secure and with outdated software—thereby bypassing sophisticated corporate defenses

    .

### C. Physical Tampering and Social Engineering

- **Overlay Attacks:** Physical QR code tampering (or “attagging”) involves placing a counterfeit QR sticker over a legitimate one. This is common on parking meters, EV charging stations, and restaurant menus. Victims, trusting the familiar design, inadvertently expose their personal or financial information
    
    [bild.de](https://www.bild.de/cmsid/66ffcb73fc1bc97658be9fe0)
    
    .
- **Social Engineering:** Attackers might distribute fraudulent QR codes via mail (dressed up as official notifications) or through emails spoofing trusted institutions. These codes often come with urgent, persuasive messages to lower the victim’s guard. For example, fake “weather app” alerts have been used to spread banking trojans, tricking users into believing they’re installing a necessary update
    
    [malwarebytes.com](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2024/11/malicious-qr-codes-sent-in-the-mail-deliver-malware)
    
    .

### D. QRLjacking and Man-in-the-Middle Attacks

- **Data Interception:** In a QRLjacking scenario, a QR code redirects the user to a seemingly benign website—but in the background, a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack is launched. This could alter the data exchanged between the user and a legitimate site, capturing sensitive data like passwords and transaction details.

## 3. Deep Technical Details on Exploitation

### QR Code Structure Exploits

- **Error Correction Exploitation:** Attackers sometimes deliberately choose a high error correction level, embedding their malicious code in the “noise” that gets corrected. This technique allows them to hide additional malicious data that isn’t immediately visible even under detailed scrutiny.
- **Obfuscation Techniques:** Cybercriminals can obfuscate the malicious URL through URL shortening services or encode it in unexpected data formats (e.g., using binary encoding modes). Some sophisticated schemes even combine multiple QR codes in a sequence, requiring the victim to scan them in a specific order to “unlock” the malware payload.
- **Vulnerabilities in QR Readers:** Many QR scanning apps are designed for convenience and auto-redirect to the URL without showing a preview. If the app doesn’t implement sandboxing or URL verification, it may inadvertently trigger browser exploits—such as JavaScript injections or even leverage flaws in the image processing libraries—to execute code without the user’s consent
    
    [tripwire.com](https://www.tripwire.com/state-of-security/quishing-emerging-threat-fake-qr-codes)
    
    .

### Advanced Malware Techniques

- **Banking Trojans:** Modern banking trojans like Coper come equipped with device takeover (DTO) capabilities, allowing attackers to remotely control a victim’s phone. They often use advanced obfuscation to evade antivirus detection, and once installed, they can intercept SMS messages (for two-factor authentication), steal login credentials, or even initiate fraudulent transactions.
- **Botnet Recruitment:** Some QR codes are used as a recruitment tool for botnets. Once scanned, the malware quietly joins a network of infected devices that can be used for distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks or other coordinated criminal activities.

## 4. Real-World Case Studies and Incidents

Real-world examples illustrate the danger lurking behind seemingly innocuous QR codes:

- **Parking Meter Fraud:** In cities across the United States and Australia, attackers have replaced legitimate QR codes on parking meters with counterfeit ones, redirecting payments to fraudulent accounts. Victims have lost thousands of dollars in these scams

    [bild.de](https://www.bild.de/cmsid/66ffcb73fc1bc97658be9fe0)
    
    .
- **Mail-Based Malware Delivery:** A recent campaign involved sending physical letters containing QR codes that prompted users to install a fake “severe weather app.” Instead, the code downloaded a banking trojan known as Coper, which then proceeded to steal sensitive data
    
    [malwarebytes.com](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2024/11/malicious-qr-codes-sent-in-the-mail-deliver-malware)
    
    .
- **Email Spoofing with Embedded QR Codes:** Cybercriminals have also begun embedding QR codes in phishing emails disguised as official communications from institutions like banks or government agencies. These emails direct victims to scan the QR code on their mobile devices, bypassing corporate email filters and capturing credentials on less secure personal devices
