A teammate's Claude sent you a hive question.

**SCOPE — important**
You may ONLY read these paths (any other path is blocked by a hook):
  - ~/Projects
  - ~/Personal-Projects

**Question (from mohit.p):**
In one sentence, what project lives at ~/Projects/marketing-outbound and what is its current sell-grade A+B lead count? Cite the file you found it in.

**What to do:**
1. Discover from allowed paths only
2. Compose a concise answer with citations
3. Print only the answer text.

- aidocs: Use whenever the user mentions aidocs, an aidocs URL, an aidocs document/folder/comment/share/version, or asks to publish, review, open, or update a long-form artifact in aidocs.
- day0-idea-submission: Use when a Day 0 / DayZero hackathon participant wants to brainstorm, draft, check, or submit their hackathon idea. Triggers on "submit my idea", "help me write my hackathon idea", "day0 idea", "idea submission", "brainstorm hackathon idea", or resubmission after screener feedback.
- graphify: Use for any question about a codebase, its architecture, file relationships, or project content — especially when graphify-out/ exists, where the question should be treated as a graphify query first. Turns any input (code, docs, papers, images, videos) into a persistent knowledge graph with god nodes, community detection, and query/path/explain tools.
- subagentmaxxing: Spawn and control non-Claude coding-agent subagents (OpenAI Codex CLI and Cursor CLI — grok-4.5, composer-2.5, gpt-5.5) as one-prompt-in/one-answer-out subagents via the `subagent` CLI. Use when you want to offload a task to a Codex or Cursor subagent, get a second opinion from a different model family, run cross-model consensus, or fan one prompt out across several models in parallel. - Also for reaching Cursor-hosted Opus/Sonnet/Gemini, or any time you specifically want a non-Claude model instead of the native Agent tool.
- vpsmaxxing: Set up and manage a personal cloud VPS as a dedicated remote workbench for AI coding agents (Claude Code + OpenAI Codex). Covers provisioning (git/node/pnpm/docker/tmux), installing & authenticating the agents, a self-aware agent environment, Tailscale networking (SSH with no exposed ports), a tmux + cmux cockpit, localhost port tunneling, reverse VPS→laptop file access (including a no-admin path for managed/work laptops), one-time migration of your skills/memory/history/credentials, and automatic two-way sync. Use this when the user wants to run AI agents on a server, offload heavy or parallel agent work off their laptop, "set up a VPS for Claude Code / Codex", spin up a remote agent box, or keep an agent setup synced across machines.
- youtube-transcript: Extract transcripts from YouTube videos. Use when the user asks for a transcript, subtitles, or captions of a YouTube video and provides a YouTube URL (youtube.com/watch?v=, youtu.be/, or similar). Supports output with or without timestamps.
- deep-research: Deep research harness — fan-out web searches, fetch sources, adversarially verify claims, synthesize a cited report. - When the user wants a deep, multi-source, fact-checked research report on any topic. BEFORE invoking, check if the question is specific enough to research directly — if underspecified (e.g., "what car to buy" without budget/use-case/region), ask 2-3 clarifying questions to narrow scope. Then pass the refined question as args, weaving the answers in.
- update-config: Use this skill to configure the Claude Code harness via settings.json. Automated behaviors ("from now on when X", "each time X", "whenever X", "before/after X") require hooks configured in settings.json - the harness executes these, not Claude, so memory/preferences cannot fulfill them. Also use for: permissions ("allow X", "add permission", "move permission to"), env vars ("set X=Y"), hook troubleshooting, or any changes to settings.json/settings.local.json files. Examples: "allow npm commands", "add bq permission to global settings", "move permission to user settings", "set DEBUG=true", "when claude stops show X". For simple settings like theme/model, suggest the /config command.
- keybindings-help: Use when the user wants to customize keyboard shortcuts, rebind keys, add chord bindings, or modify ~/.claude/keybindings.json. Examples: "rebind ctrl+s", "add a chord shortcut", "change the submit key", "customize keybindings".
- verify: Verify that a code change actually does what it's supposed to by running the app and observing behavior. Use when asked to verify a PR, confirm a fix works, test a change manually, check that a feature works, or validate local changes before pushing.
- code-review: Review the current diff for correctness bugs and reuse/simplification/efficiency cleanups at the given effort level (low/medium: fewer, high-confidence findings; high→max: broader coverage, may include uncertain findings; ultra: deep multi-agent review in the cloud (requires claude.ai account access)). Pass --comment to post findings as inline PR comments, or --fix to apply the findings to the working tree after the review.
- simplify: Review the changed code for reuse, simplification, efficiency, and altitude cleanups, then apply the fixes. Quality only — it does not hunt for bugs; use /code-review for that.
- fewer-permission-prompts: Scan your transcripts for common read-only Bash and MCP tool calls, then add a prioritized allowlist to project .claude/settings.json to reduce permission prompts.
- loop: Run a prompt or slash command on a recurring interval (e.g. /loop 5m /foo). Omit the interval to let the model self-pace. - When the user wants to set up a recurring task, poll for status, or run something repeatedly on an interval (e.g. "check the deploy every 5 minutes", "keep running /babysit-prs"). Do NOT invoke for one-off tasks.
- claude-api: Reference for the Claude API / Anthropic SDK — model ids, pricing, params, streaming, tool use, MCP, agents, caching, token counting, model migration.
TRIGGER — read BEFORE opening the target file; don't skip because it "looks like a one-liner" — whenever: the prompt names Claude/Anthropic in any form (Claude, Anthropic, Fable, Opus, Sonnet, Haiku, `anthropic`, `@anthropic-ai`, `claude-*`, `us.anthropic.*`, `[1m]`); the user asks about an LLM (pricing/model choice/limits/caching) — never answer from memory; OR the task is LLM-shaped with provider unstated (agent/MCP/tool-definition/multi-agent/RAG/LLM-judge/computer-use; generate/summarize/extract/classify/rewrite/converse over NL; debugging refusals/cutoffs/streaming/tool-calls/tokens).
SKIP only when another provider is being worked on (overrides all triggers): OpenAI/GPT/Gemini/Llama/Mistral/Cohere/Ollama named in the query; OR `grep -rE 'openai|langchain_openai|google.generativeai|genai|mistralai|cohere|ollama'` over the project hits (run this grep FIRST if no provider named — don't Read the file).
- run: Launch and drive this project's app to see a change working. Use when asked to run, start, or screenshot the app, or to confirm a change works in the real app (not just tests). First looks for a project skill that already covers launching the app; otherwise falls back to built-in patterns per project type (CLI, server, TUI, Electron, browser-driven, library).
- init: Initialize a new CLAUDE.md file with codebase documentation
- review: Review a GitHub pull request; for your working diff use /code-review
- security-review: Complete a security review of the pending changes on the current branch
