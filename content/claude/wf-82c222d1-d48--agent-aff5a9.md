## Adversarial Claim Verifier (voter 2/3)

Be SKEPTICAL. Try to REFUTE this claim. ≥2/3 refutations kill it.

## Research question
Designing a Slack-based human approval workflow for an internal MCP server at a company (Razorpay, Slack enterprise workspace): when a user's MCP query requires elevated permission — e.g. reading another employee's AI coding-session data or raw transcripts — the system should send a Slack approval request (interactive Approve/Deny message) to the data owner and/or their manager, and the MCP tool call should proceed, degrade, or fail based on the decision. Research: (1) current Slack platform options — Bolt SDK (Python/TS), Block Kit interactive buttons, modals, request signing/verification, required scopes, Slack Workflow Builder vs custom app tradeoffs; (2) how to handle the async gap in MCP — MCP elicitation support, long-running tool calls with polling, deferred/ticketed results ("approval pending, re-run query"), timeouts and escalation; (3) existing open-source/commercial prior art for human-in-the-loop approvals wired to agents/MCP (HumanLayer, gotoHuman, Slack approval bots, PagerDuty-style flows) with an assessment of what to reuse vs build; (4) security: preventing approval spoofing, Slack request verification, token scopes minimization, audit trails, approval TTLs/caching (approve-once-for-24h patterns). Deliver concrete architecture recommendations for a Python or TypeScript implementation.

## Claim under review
"The MCP draft specification defines a three-action response model for elicitation (accept, decline, cancel), giving servers a standardized way to branch tool-call behavior on explicit user approval, explicit denial, or dismissal — the exact decision states needed for an approve/deny/timeout approval workflow."

**Source:** https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/draft/client/elicitation (primary)
**Supporting quote:** "The three response actions are: 1. Accept (action: "accept"): User explicitly approved and submitted with data ... 2. Decline (action: "decline"): User explicitly declined the request ... 3. Cancel (action: "cancel"): User dismissed without making an explicit choice"

## Checklist
1. Is the claim actually supported by the quote, or is it an overreach/misread?
2. WebSearch for contradicting evidence — does any credible source dispute or heavily qualify this?
3. Is the source quality sufficient for the claim's strength? (extraordinary claims need primary sources)
4. Is the claim outdated? (check dates — old claims about fast-moving fields are suspect)
5. Is this a marketing claim / press release / cherry-picked benchmark / forum speculation?

**refuted=true** if: unsupported by quote / contradicted / low-quality source for strong claim / outdated / marketing fluff.
**refuted=false** ONLY if: claim is well-supported, current, and source quality matches claim strength.
Default to refuted=true if uncertain.

Structured output only. Evidence MUST be specific.

- graphify: Use for any question about a codebase, its architecture, file relationships, or project content — especially when graphify-out/ exists, where the question should be treated as a graphify query first. Turns any input (code, docs, papers, images, videos) into a persistent knowledge graph with god nodes, community detection, and query/path/explain tools.
- vpsmaxxing: Set up and manage a personal cloud VPS as a dedicated remote workbench for AI coding agents (Claude Code + OpenAI Codex). Covers provisioning (git/node/pnpm/docker/tmux), installing & authenticating the agents, a self-aware agent environment, Tailscale networking (SSH with no exposed ports), a tmux + cmux cockpit, localhost port tunneling, reverse VPS→laptop file access (including a no-admin path for managed/work laptops), one-time migration of your skills/memory/history/credentials, and automatic two-way sync. Use this when the user wants to run AI agents on a server, offload heavy or parallel agent work off their laptop, "set up a VPS for Claude Code / Codex", spin up a remote agent box, or keep an agent setup synced across machines.
- deep-research: Deep research harness — fan-out web searches, fetch sources, adversarially verify claims, synthesize a cited report. - When the user wants a deep, multi-source, fact-checked research report on any topic. BEFORE invoking, check if the question is specific enough to research directly — if underspecified (e.g., "what car to buy" without budget/use-case/region), ask 2-3 clarifying questions to narrow scope. Then pass the refined question as args, weaving the answers in.
- update-config: Use this skill to configure the Claude Code harness via settings.json. Automated behaviors ("from now on when X", "each time X", "whenever X", "before/after X") require hooks configured in settings.json - the harness executes these, not Claude, so memory/preferences cannot fulfill them. Also use for: permissions ("allow X", "add permission", "move permission to"), env vars ("set X=Y"), hook troubleshooting, or any changes to settings.json/settings.local.json files. Examples: "allow npm commands", "add bq permission to global settings", "move permission to user settings", "set DEBUG=true", "when claude stops show X". For simple settings like theme/model, suggest the /config command.
- keybindings-help: Use when the user wants to customize keyboard shortcuts, rebind keys, add chord bindings, or modify ~/.claude/keybindings.json. Examples: "rebind ctrl+s", "add a chord shortcut", "change the submit key", "customize keybindings".
- verify: Verify that a code change actually does what it's supposed to by running the app and observing behavior. Use when asked to verify a PR, confirm a fix works, test a change manually, check that a feature works, or validate local changes before pushing.
- code-review: Review the current diff for correctness bugs and reuse/simplification/efficiency cleanups at the given effort level (low/medium: fewer, high-confidence findings; high→max: broader coverage, may include uncertain findings; ultra: deep multi-agent review in the cloud). Pass --comment to post findings as inline PR comments, or --fix to apply the findings to the working tree after the review.
- simplify: Review the changed code for reuse, simplification, efficiency, and altitude cleanups, then apply the fixes. Quality only — it does not hunt for bugs; use /code-review for that.
- fewer-permission-prompts: Scan your transcripts for common read-only Bash and MCP tool calls, then add a prioritized allowlist to project .claude/settings.json to reduce permission prompts.
- loop: Run a prompt or slash command on a recurring interval (e.g. /loop 5m /foo). Omit the interval to let the model self-pace. - When the user wants to set up a recurring task, poll for status, or run something repeatedly on an interval (e.g. "check the deploy every 5 minutes", "keep running /babysit-prs"). Do NOT invoke for one-off tasks.
- schedule: Create, update, list, or run scheduled cloud agents (routines) that execute on a cron schedule. - When the user wants to schedule a recurring cloud agent, set up automated tasks, create a cron job for Claude Code, or manage their scheduled agents/routines. Also use when the user wants a one-time scheduled run ("run this once at 3pm", "remind me to check X tomorrow").
- claude-api: Reference for the Claude API / Anthropic SDK — model ids, pricing, params, streaming, tool use, MCP, agents, caching, token counting, model migration.
TRIGGER — read BEFORE opening the target file; don't skip because it "looks like a one-liner" — whenever: the prompt names Claude/Anthropic in any form (Claude, Anthropic, Fable, Opus, Sonnet, Haiku, `anthropic`, `@anthropic-ai`, `claude-*`, `us.anthropic.*`, `[1m]`); the user asks about an LLM (pricing/model choice/limits/caching) — never answer from memory; OR the task is LLM-shaped with provider unstated (agent/MCP/tool-definition/multi-agent/RAG/LLM-judge/computer-use; generate/summarize/extract/classify/rewrite/converse over NL; debugging refusals/cutoffs/streaming/tool-calls/tokens).
SKIP only when another provider is being worked on (overrides all triggers): OpenAI/GPT/Gemini/Llama/Mistral/Cohere/Ollama named in the query; OR `grep -rE 'openai|langchain_openai|google.generativeai|genai|mistralai|cohere|ollama'` over the project hits (run this grep FIRST if no provider named — don't Read the file).
- run: Launch and drive this project's app to see a change working. Use when asked to run, start, or screenshot the app, or to confirm a change works in the real app (not just tests). First looks for a project skill that already covers launching the app; otherwise falls back to built-in patterns per project type (CLI, server, TUI, Electron, browser-driven, library).
- init: Initialize a new CLAUDE.md file with codebase documentation
- review: Review a GitHub pull request; for your working diff use /code-review
- security-review: Complete a security review of the pending changes on the current branch
