BeReal, the social media app that encouraged users to share unfiltered, dual-image posts of themselves, experienced a rapid rise in popularity in 2022. Its unique value proposition of promoting authenticity and realness amidst a sea of curated social media profiles garnered significant attention. However, within a year, the platform's growth stalled, and its user base began to decline.

## The Rise of BeReal

BeReal's rise can be attributed to several key factors:

1. **The "Realness" Factor**: Users were drawn to the app's premise of encouraging authenticity. By requiring users to post two simultaneous images of their current activity within a narrow time frame, BeReal sought to create a space free from the perfection often found on other social media platforms. This real-time, unfiltered approach resonated with many users seeking a more genuine online experience.
    
2. **The Novelty of Spontaneity**: BeReal's timed posting mechanic added an element of spontaneity and unpredictability, creating a sense of excitement and curiosity. Users enjoyed the surprise of seeing others' posts and the opportunity to capture and share their own candid moments.
    
3. **User Engagement**: The platform's interactive nature fostered a high level of user engagement. The dual-image format prompted users to actively participate, and the real-time aspect encouraged frequent checking of the app. This increased interaction and engagement between users, fostering a sense of community and connection.
    

## The Fall of BeReal

Despite its initial success, BeReal's downfall was swift and steep. Several key factors contributed to its decline:

4. **Lack of Variety and Innovation**: BeReal failed to build upon its initial success and introduce new features or content varieties. The daily routine of posting twice daily lost its allure as users craved more variety and depth to their social media experiences. Other platforms offered a broader range of content, from long-form writing to reels and stories, keeping users engaged and entertained.
    
5. **Privacy and Safety Concerns**: The very nature of BeReal, which prioritized real-time authenticity, left users vulnerable to potential risks and dangers. The platform became a hotbed for cyberbullying and harassment, as the simultaneous posting feature left users unable to control or curate their content. The lack of robust safety measures and content moderation deterred many users, especially those concerned about their online privacy.
    
6. **Limited Discovery and Search Functionality**: BeReal did not prioritize helping users discover and connect with diverse content creators. The platform lacked advanced search options, recommendations, or algorithms to help users expand their network beyond their immediate connections. This limited users' ability to explore and engage with the app over the long term.
    
7. **The Great Instagram Reign**: The dominance of Instagram, a seasoned social media giant, posed a significant challenge to BeReal. Instagram's constant evolution and introduction of new features, such as Reels and IGTV, kept it relevant and adaptable to users' changing preferences. BeReal failed to offer a compelling alternative to Instagram's ever-growing ecosystem.
    

## What Could Have Been Done?

BeReal could have implemented several strategies to prolong its success and avoid a swift decline:

8. **Diversify Content and Features**: BeReal could have expanded its content offerings and introduced new, innovative features to keep users engaged and on the platform. This could have included options for various forms of media, such as short videos, stories, or even text-based content, creating a more well-rounded social experience.
    
9. **Prioritize User Safety**: Implementing robust safety measures, such as improved content moderation, user reporting options, and better privacy controls, could have created a safer online environment. This would have encouraged users to continue using the platform without concerns about their well-being.
    
10. **Enhance User Discovery**: BeReal should have focused on improving user discovery and search capabilities. Implementing advanced algorithms, personalized recommendations, and a broader exploration of content would have helped users connect beyond their immediate circles, increasing the platform's stickiness.
    
11. **Integrate Creator Monetization**: To retain top creators and incentivize their continued presence on the platform, BeReal could have introduced features for content creators to monetize their work. This could have fostered a sense of community and loyalty among users aiming to support their favorite creators.
    
12. **Learn from the Masters**: Instead of competing head-on with established platforms like Instagram, BeReal could have explored partnerships or integrations with existing social media giants. Learning from these successful platforms' strategies and leveraging their infrastructure could have helped BeReal expand its reach and durability.
    

In conclusion, BeReal's rapid rise and fall serve as a reminder of the fleeting nature of social media trends. To avoid a similar downfall, platforms must continuously evolve, innovate, and prioritize user engagement and safety. The lesson for social media companies is clear: constant adaptation and improvement are essential to sustain success in the ever-changing digital landscape.
