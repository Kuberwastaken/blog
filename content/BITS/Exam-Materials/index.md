**This part contains the reference materials I used for exams** *(yes, even in the online test)*

is it the absolute best set of materials to study the subjects?
- no 
would it be good enough to make sure you pass?
- yes (probably)

all the links are hosted in MEGA (at least currently) for simplicity, feel free to download whatever you need, along with some tips for some subjects you might find helpful

**ðŸ§­Navigation guide:**

- I'm too lazy to make index pages for each part so please refer to the file system on the left directly if you're on PC and turn your phone horizontal to see it if you're on mobile ðŸ¥°
