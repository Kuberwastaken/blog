**This part contains the reference materials I used for exams** *(yes, even in the online test)*

is it the absolute best set of materials to study the subjects?
- no 

would it be good enough to make sure you pass?
- yes (probably)

all the links are hosted in MEGA (at least currently) for simplicity, feel free to download whatever you need, along with some tips for some subjects you might find helpful
