## DISCRETE MATHEMATICS

Here's the content I used for DM:
https://mega.nz/folder/cIgjGAZA#t812Ak1GCUbxNgDX0gObcA

- Honestly a bit easy for being a mathematics course for some reason?
- Study from the start, or you won't get what's happening towards the end 
- Online classes were... okay

- Pro Tip: Search the assignment/ exam questions in Rossen after you're done, you'll cry tears of joy ;)
