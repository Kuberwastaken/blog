Hi! If you are here, you're probably a BITS Online student 
or you just like to find easter eggs in websites :P

Those of you who don't know me,
Hi! My name is Kuber Mehta and I'm a C4 student (2024 batch) from New Delhi, India

This is an unlisted part of my website simply for BITS Online students and contains many things you might find useful
Do note that you need [this link](https://kuberwastaken.github.io/blog/BITS) to be able to access the contents here since this page is unlisted.

I wouldn't put things for the batches above me at the moment for obvious reasons, this website has stuff that I've personally experienced :)

Some topics you might find to your interest:

- [Exam Materials](https://kuberwastaken.github.io/blog/BITS/Exam-Materials/index) - The stuff I used to study for BITS exams (and refer during the test)
- More soon? Probably? (get in touch if you have ideas)
