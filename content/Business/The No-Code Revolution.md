No-code platforms like Bubble, Webflow, and Adalo are turning ‚Äúnon-technical‚Äù into a misnomer. These tools let founders build apps, automate workflows, and launch MVPs without writing a single line of code‚Äîbut they‚Äôre not a silver bullet.

## Pros of No-Code Development

- **Speed & Cost**  
  Launch a functional MVP in days for <$1,000. A solo founder built a freelance job-matching app on Bubble in 72 hours.

- **Democratization**  
  60% of no-code users have no programming background, per Zapier. Marketers, designers, and ops managers can now own product development.

- **Iteration Freedom**  
  Test ideas without waiting for dev teams. A DTC brand increased conversion rates by A/B testing 10 landing page variants in a week using Webflow.

## Cons of No-Code Development

- **Scalability Limits**  
  No-code apps often buckle under heavy traffic or complex logic. One viral mindfulness app crashed at 50k users, forcing a costly rebuild in React.

- **Vendor Lock-In**  
  Migrating from Bubble to custom code is like ‚Äúmoving a house brick by brick,‚Äù admits a founder who lost months transitioning his SaaS tool.

- **Customization Ceiling**  
  Need a unique algorithm or third-party API integration? You‚Äôll hit no-code‚Äôs limits fast.

## The Future of No-Code

- **AI Integration**: Tools like Debuild now let users describe an app in plain text (‚ÄúA TikTok for pet owners‚Äù) and generate no-code prototypes via GPT-4.
- **Enterprise Adoption**: Companies like Airbnb use no-code to empower employees to build internal tools, reducing IT backlogs by 30%.

## Conclusion

For No-Code Builders: Leverage speed to test ideas, but plan an exit strategy to custom code before scaling.
