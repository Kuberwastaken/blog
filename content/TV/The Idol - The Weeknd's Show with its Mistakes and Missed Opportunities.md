HBO’s *The Idol* promised a gritty, unflinching look at the music industry’s underbelly-think *Euphoria* meets *Behind the Music*. Instead, it stumbled into a confusing mix of shock value, half-baked ideas, and missed opportunities. Let’s unpack why this show fizzled when it should have sizzled.

## **The Plot Holes: Stories That Went Nowhere**  

### **Nikki’s Power Play (That Never Played Out)**  
Nikki (Jane Adams), Jocelyn’s manager, teased a corporate coup by eyeing Tedros’ cult as a talent goldmine. Destiny and Hayum even whispered about going rogue. But these threads? Dropped faster than a bad single. Imagine *Succession* without the betrayals-pointless.  

### **Chloe’s Underage Mystery (That Stayed a Mystery)**  
Chloe (Suzanna Son) lurked in the background like a horror movie extra-underage, wide-eyed, and creepily obsessed with Tedros. But her backstory? Buried deeper than Tedros’ dignity. A wasted chance to explore exploitation in the industry.  

### **Leia’s Vanishing Act**  
Leia (Rachel Sennott), Jocelyn’s assistant, spent the season side-eyeing Tedros… only to exit stage left without explanation. What was in her note? The show’s writers apparently lost the key to that subplot.  

### **The Cult’s Flip-Flop Loyalty**  
Tedros’ cult went from ride-or-die to ghosting him overnight. No buildup, no reason-just vibes. Their sudden indifference made the Illuminati look well-organized.

## **The Finale: A Confused Identity Crisis**

### **Jocelyn’s Villain Twist (That Came Out of Nowhere)**  
The “big reveal” that Jocelyn (Lily-Rose Depp) was the puppet master all along felt less like a twist and more like a Hail Mary pass. We spent five episodes watching her unravel from grief-suddenly she’s a mastermind? Even *Game of Thrones* had better foreshadowing.  

### **Tedros’ Unearned Sympathy Arc**  
After gaslighting, manipulating, and creeping his way through the series, the finale tried to make us pity Tedros (The Weeknd). But watching him cry in a stairwell? Satisfying, not sad. You don’t get a redemption arc when your entire personality is a red flag.

## **Style Over Substance: Shock Scenes That Added Nothing**  

HBO loves pushing boundaries, but *The Idol* confused “provocative” with “pointless.” Tedros’ cringey seduction tactics and Jocelyn’s endless nude scenes ate up screen time that could’ve been used to:  
- **Explore Jocelyn’s grief** (her mom’s death was a footnote!).  
- **Dive into industry politics** (where were the label execs, the contracts, the *drama*?).  
- **Explain Tedros’ motives** (why cults? Why hair gel? Why *any* of this?).

## **Casting Woes: Great Actors, Wasted Potential**  

### **The Weeknd’s Tedros: A Swing and a Miss**  
Abel Tesfaye (The Weeknd) has charisma on stage, but Tedros needed layers he just couldn’t deliver. His two facial expressions-smirk and scowl-worked for a cartoon villain, not a complex antagonist. Imagine someone like Oscar Isaac in the role-*that* could’ve been chilling.  

### **Lily-Rose Depp Deserved Better**  
Depp committed to Jocelyn’s raw, messy vulnerability, but the script jerked her between victim and villain without clarity. Her performance was a diamond in a coal mine of bad writing.

## **What *The Idol* Could’ve Been**  

The ingredients were there:  
- **Industry critique**: Expose the machinery behind fame (à la *Black Swan*).  
- **Mental health exploration**: Jocelyn’s grief and identity crisis.  
- **Tedros as a nuanced antagonist**: Why cults? What’s his damage?  

Instead, we got a show that prioritized vibes over plot-a mood board masquerading as a story.

## **Final Take: A Cautionary Tale for HBO**  

*The Idol* isn’t just bad-it’s frustrating. It dangles brilliance (Lily-Rose’s acting! The industry satire!) but drowns it in poor choices. A tighter script, fewer shock scenes, and a clearer vision could’ve saved it. Instead, it’s a relic of wasted potential.  

**Rating**: 4/10  
*Points for ambition and Lily-Rose’s wardrobe. Minus points for literally everything else.*
