If you know me, you *know* **The Weeknd** is my absolute favorite artist. My friends, family, and even my imaginary girlfriend are sick of hearing about it. But after listening to his final album, ***Hurry Up Tomorrow***, I’m gonna say it again: **Abel Tesfaye is a generational talent**, and this album is the cinematic, soul-shaking farewell that we deserve, and trust me, I don't say this a lot.

## **A Journey Through Sound: Track-by-Track Highlights** 🎧

### **1. Wake Me Up**  
The album kicks off with a **leaked-but-leveled-up** intro. The initial vocal distortion had me side-eyeing my speakers, but by the third listen? Chills. The chaotic instrumental breakdown at the end? Pure *Blade Runner*-meets-heartbreak energy.  

### **2. Cry For Me**  
A moody, Metro Boomin-produced gem that doesn’t *sound* like Metro - until you feel the bass... Proof that Abel can reinvent any collaborator’s signature. 

### **3. I Can’t Fucking Sing**  
Twelve seconds of raw, haunting audio. definitely a studio reenactment or a real clip from his *SoFi Stadium voice loss incident*? Either way, it’s a jarring reminder of the man behind the myth.  

### **4. Sao Paulo ft. Anitta**  
A sultry single with a divisive twist: Anitta’s bridge vocals split the fanbase. But when Abel croons, “*I’ll love you ‘til we’re skin and bones*,” you forget everything else :)

### **5. Baptized In Fear**  
Posted and deleted mysteriously pre-release, this track dives into **dark waters** - lyrically exploring the s word in a bathtub. The transition into *Open Hearts*? Chef’s kiss 🤌🤌

### **6. Enjoy The Show ft. Future**  
Absolutely freakin brilliant. Future’s here, but Abel and that *high-pitched vocal sample* steal the spotlight. Catchy, chaotic, and dare I say... criminally underrated.  

### **7. Given Up On Me**  
A **piano-driven masterpiece** that deserved its own track. Though Imagine Sabrina Carpenter harmonizing here - *swoon*. 

### **8. Timeless ft. Playboi Carti**  
Pharrell’s production + Carti’s ad-libs = a single that slaps extremely hard. This was the big thing before the release too and it gets better every single time I listen to it.  

### **9. The Abyss ft. Lana Del Rey**  
Five years in the vault, this *Starboy x Stargirl* reunion is worth the wait. Arguably the best weeknd-lana collab there is :) 

### **10. Hurry Up Tomorrow**  
The closing track loops back to *High For This*—a poetic full-circle moment. **Cue the tears, trilogy my beloved**

## **The Controversies & Curiosities** ❓

- **“Runaway” Gate**: How is this **bonus track** not on the main album?! It’s a crime against humanity (and Spotify playlists).  
- **Where's dancing in the flames?**: *Dancing In The Flames* vanished - though after the LA wildfires... probably not the best song to perform..
- **Skit Drama**: The mid-track skits (*cough* Chxrry22 phone call *cough*) work here, unlike Drake’s *Calling For You*.

## **Why This Album Is a 10/10** 🔥

Abel didn’t just drop an album - he closed a **trilogy** (*After Hours*, *Dawn FM*, *Hurry Up Tomorrow*) that redefines modern R&B, pop, (brazillian funk!?). Clocking in at 3.5 hours for the full trilogy experience, it’s a **cinematic odyssey** of love, loss, and redemption.  

Is it perfect? No. But the flaws - like Anitta’s cameo or a too-short *Opening Night* are eclipsed by moments of genius. This isn’t just an album; it’s a **cultural reset**.

## **Final Verdict: A Love Letter to Fans** 💌

As a diehard Weeknd stan, I’ve never felt more seen. *Hurry Up Tomorrow* isn’t just Abel’s goodbye- it’s ours. It’s the **soundtrack to our late-night drives**, our heartbreaks, and our triumphs. So pour one out, hit replay, and let the synths carry you into the abyss :)

**RATING**: ✨ 10/10 ✨ (and yes, I’m biased—*deal with it*).
